### Audio Transcription

The audio will be captured in the browser while the meeting is happening. It won't be necessary to record the meeting for this purpose. The audio will be separated in 2 streams: Customer and Sales Representative (Google side). Speech API will be used to transcribe the audio to text.

### Intent Matching
After the audio is transcribed to text, we will search for words from our dictionary of Cloud Products / Solutions and complete phrases from the customer. If a match is found, it will be sended to Dialogflow agent. The response is presented to the customer, as demonstrated in the following diagram.
